# Persistent state management with Vert.x
weâ€™ll explore database and state management with Vert.x by diving into the implementation of the user and activity services. These services will allow us to use a document-oriented database (MongoDB) and a relational database (PostgreSQL).

The Eclipse Vert.x project provides the data client modules.These containes the drivers to connect to the database.
